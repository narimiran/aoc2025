&nbsp;

This year it is a Clojure time, again.

Last year's experiment with [Clerk notebooks](https://clerk.vision) was a success
(IMO; you can see [my AoC 2024 notebooks](https://narimiran.github.io/aoc2024) for yourself),
so I'll use the notebook format once again.

To make this notebook format "work", I'll have to write the code in a different way
than I usually do:
I'll not just present the final solution, but the whole process
from reading the input and then slowly building the required blocks
until we come with the solution.




## Solutions


### Clojure

It is the best to _not_ read the raw code in this repo.
Instead, read the notebooks.

The notebooks are available at: https://narimiran.github.io/aoc2025
