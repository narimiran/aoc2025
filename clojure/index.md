# Advent of Code 2025

Hello there!

- New to Clojure? Here's my [Quick intro to Clojure](https://narimiran.github.io/aoc2024/clojure_intro/) notebook from last year.
- What is `aoc-utils`? It is the library I've wrote this year, with some helper functions
  I often use for AoC tasks. Check out [its repo](https://github.com/narimiran/aoc-utils)
  and/or browse through [its documentation](https://narimiran.github.io/aoc-utils/).
- Source code of these notebooks is [available here](https://github.com/narimiran/aoc2025),
  where you can also find links to the repos with my solutions of previous AoC
  instances.
  You'll find my solutions in Clojure, Elixir, Nim, OCaml, Python, Racket;
  often multiple languages per each AoC year.
