# Advent of Code 2025

Hello there!

- New to Clojure? Here's my [Quick intro to Clojure](https://narimiran.github.io/aoc2024/clojure_intro/) notebook from last year.
- What is `aoc-utils`? It is the library I've wrote this year, with some helper functions
  I often use for AoC tasks. Check out [its repo](https://github.com/narimiran/aoc-utils)
  and/or browse through [its documentation](https://narimiran.github.io/aoc-utils/).
- Looking for my solutions of previous years? Take a look
  [at the links here](https://github.com/narimiran/aoc2025),
  there you'll find my solutions in Clojure, Elixir, Nim, OCaml, Python, Racket;
  often multiple languages per each AoC year.

Day 0: aoc-utils helper package                                             | [aoc-utils](https://narimiran.github.io/aoc-utils/) |                                |                      | Helper package I'll use for each task.
Day 1: [Secret Entrance](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1)               | [day01.clj](src/day01) | subs, mapcat, reductions       | bench                | Harder than expected for day 1.
Day 2: [Gift Shop](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2)                     | [day02.clj](src/day02) | partition, re-matches          | optimization         | Easier than Day 1.
Day 3: [Lobby](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/3)                         | [day03.clj](src/day03) | reduce-kv, reduced, partial    |                      | Recursion made easy.
